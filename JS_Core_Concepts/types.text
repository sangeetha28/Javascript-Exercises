Dynamic Typing: 

You don't tell the JS engine what type of data a variable holds, JS engine will figure out while your code is running 

Variables can hold different types of values because it's all figured out during the execution

Unlike other programming language like Java or c#, we don't have to tell the compiler ahead of time which type of data the variable is going to hold.( Static Typing)
